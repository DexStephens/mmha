            Sadness and depression are described as feelings of sorrow,
            unhappiness, and grief, and they are a normal part of our experience
            here on earth. Sadness and depression can come through difficulties
            resulting from rejection, interpersonal relationships,
            disappointments, and other pains. They are difficult, yet essential,
            growth. Elder Bruce C. Hafen taught that Heavenly Father meant for
            us to have painful experiences in our lives so we could ultimately
            experience joy more fully.

            Talk: Sister Reyna Aburto: Sister Reyna I. Aburto taught: “Like any
            part of the body, the brain is subject to illnesses, trauma, and
            chemical imbalances. When our minds are suffering, it is appropriate
            to seek help from God, from those around us, and from medical and
            mental health professionals. …“It is normal to feel sad or worried
            once in a while. Sadness and anxiety are natural human emotions.
            However, if we are constantly sad and if our pain blocks our ability
            to feel the love of our Heavenly Father and His Son and the
            influence of the Holy Ghost, then we may be suffering from
            depression, anxiety, or another emotional condition” (
