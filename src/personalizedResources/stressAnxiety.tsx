            Stress and anxiety are normal parts of life. These words describe
            ways the brain and body respond to any demand, such as a problem at
            work, a test at school, or an important decision. Normal amounts of
            stress and anxiety can help you focus, reach your goals, and protect
            your body. For example, if you have some stress about your job, you
            will likely come to work prepared and focused on your tasks.

            Mindfulness: “Mindfulness is a skill that will help you be more
            emotionally resilient. It is paying attention to what your body is
            telling you in the here and now. It can help reduce stress and
            anxiety and increase your sense of well-being and confidence.
            Mindfulness also helps you avoid being overly reactive or
            overwhelmed by what’s happening around you.”

            Talk: President Dallin H. Oaks taught of Christ’s ability to
            strengthen us in any situation we face: “He therefore knows our
            struggles, our heartaches, our temptations, and our suffering, for
            He willingly experienced them all as an essential part of His
            Atonement. And because of this, His Atonement empowers Him to succor
            us—to give us the strength to bear it all. …“… Our Savior’s
            Atonement does more than assure us of immortality by a universal
            resurrection and give us the opportunity to be cleansed from sin by
            repentance and baptism. His Atonement also provides the opportunity
            to call upon Him who has experienced all of our mortal infirmities
            to give us the strength to bear the burdens of mortality. He knows
            of our anguish, and He is there for us. Like the good Samaritan,
            when He finds us wounded at the wayside, He will bind up our wounds
            and care for us (see Luke 10:34). The healing and strengthening
            power of Jesus Christ and His Atonement is for all of us who will
            ask” (
